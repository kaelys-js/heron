# Mode: pdf — ATS-Optimized PDF Generation

## Full pipeline

1. Read `__CV__` as the source of truth
2. Ask the user for the JD if it isn't in context (text or URL)
3. Extract 15–20 keywords from the JD
4. Detect the JD language → CV language (EN default)
5. Detect company location → paper format:
   - US/Canada → `letter`
   - Rest of world → `a4`
6. Detect the role's archetype → adapt framing
7. Rewrite the Professional Summary injecting JD keywords + an exit-narrative bridge ("Built and sold a business. Now applying systems thinking to [JD domain].")
8. Select the top 3–4 projects most relevant to the offer
9. Reorder experience bullets by relevance to the JD
10. Build the competency grid from the JD requirements (6–8 keyword phrases)
11. Inject keywords naturally into existing achievements (NEVER invent)
12. Generate the full HTML from the template + personalized content
13. Read `name` from `config/profile.yml` → normalize to kebab-case lowercase (e.g. "John Doe" → "john-doe") → `{candidate}`
14. Write HTML to `/tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.html`
15. Run: `node generate-pdf.mjs /tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.html __OUTPUT__/cv-{candidate}-{company}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf --format={letter|a4}`
    - generate-pdf.mjs automatically reads the template's `<meta>` tags (author, subject, keywords, description) and injects them into the PDF Info dictionary. No need to pass `--author=...` via CLI if the HTML carries them.
    - The PDF is generated with `tagged: true` (PDF/UA) by default — semantic structure tags that help ATS parsers and screen readers.
16. **Validate ATS compatibility**: `node ats-check.mjs __OUTPUT__/cv-{candidate}-{company}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf`
    - Score < 90% → review warnings, adjust template/content, regenerate.
    - The check verifies: complete metadata, normalized unicode, standard section headers, preserved hyperlinks, reading order, page count, file size, no embedded JS/forms/encryption.
17. **ALSO write the SOURCE markdown of the tailored version** to `__OUTPUT__/cv-{candidate}-{company}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (sibling of the .pdf).
    - This preserves the tailored content for later analysis (cv-variant-analysis correlates injected keywords with outcomes).
    - The .md must contain EVERY tailored CV section — it isn't the HTML, it's the structured markdown the mode produced in steps 7–11.
    - Without this sibling, /api/profile/cv-variants returns "Not enough data" even if there are 50+ PDFs.
18. Report: PDF path, page count, % keyword coverage, **ATS score**.

## ATS rules (clean parsing)

- Single-column layout (no sidebars, no parallel columns)
- Standard headers: "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Certifications", "Projects"
- No text inside images/SVGs
- No critical info in PDF headers/footers (ATS ignores them)
- UTF-8, selectable text (not rasterized)
- No nested tables
- JD keywords distributed: Summary (top 5), first bullet of every role, Skills section

## PDF design

- **Fonts**: Inter (400–700, single family for headings + body)
- **Self-hosted fonts**: `fonts/`
- **Header**: name in Inter 28px bold + gradient line `linear-gradient(to right, hsl(187,74%,32%), hsl(270,70%,45%))` 2px + contact row
- **Section headers**: Inter 12px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em, cyan primary color
- **Body**: Inter 11px, line-height 1.5
- **Company names**: accent purple `hsl(270,70%,45%)`
- **Margins**: 0.6in
- **Background**: pure white

## Section order (optimized for the "6-second recruiter scan")

1. Header (big name, gradient, contact, portfolio link)
2. Professional Summary (3–4 lines, keyword-dense)
3. Core Competencies (6–8 keyword phrases in a flex-grid)
4. Work Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Projects (top 3–4 most relevant)
6. Education & Certifications
7. Skills (languages + technical)

## Keyword-injection strategy (ethical, truth-based)

Examples of legitimate rewording:
- JD says "RAG pipelines" and CV says "LLM workflows with retrieval" → change to "RAG pipeline design and LLM orchestration workflows"
- JD says "MLOps" and CV says "observability, evals, error handling" → change to "MLOps and observability: evals, error handling, cost monitoring"
- JD says "stakeholder management" and CV says "collaborated with team" → change to "stakeholder management across engineering, operations, and business"

**NEVER add skills the candidate doesn't have. Only reword real experience using the JD's exact vocabulary.**

## HTML template

Use the template at `cv-template.html`. Replace the `{{...}}` placeholders with personalized content:

| Placeholder | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| `{{LANG}}` | `en` |
| `{{PAGE_WIDTH}}` | `8.5in` (letter) or `210mm` (A4) |
| `{{NAME}}` | (from profile.yml) |
| `{{ROLE_TITLE}}` | The exact role title from the JD (e.g. "Senior Software Engineer"). Appears in the HTML `<title>` and becomes the PDF Title metadata — recruiters file by this. |
| `{{ROLE_AT_COMPANY}}` | `"<role> — <company>"` (e.g. "Senior Software Engineer — Acme Corp"). Becomes the PDF Subject metadata — many ATSes sort by this field. |
| `{{KEYWORDS_CSV}}` | Comma-separated list of the 15–20 JD keywords (e.g. `"Python, TypeScript, RAG, MLOps, LangChain, …"`). Becomes the PDF Keywords metadata — several ATSes index by this field. |
| `{{SUMMARY_DESCRIPTION}}` | First line of the Professional Summary (≤ 150 chars). Becomes the PDF Description metadata. |
| `{{PHONE}}` | (from profile.yml — include with its separator only when `profile.yml` has a non-empty `phone` value; omit both `<span>` and `<span class="separator">` otherwise) |
| `{{EMAIL}}` | (from profile.yml) |
| `{{LINKEDIN_URL}}` | [from profile.yml] |
| `{{LINKEDIN_DISPLAY}}` | [from profile.yml] |
| `{{PORTFOLIO_URL}}` | [from profile.yml] |
| `{{PORTFOLIO_DISPLAY}}` | [from profile.yml] |
| `{{LOCATION}}` | [from profile.yml] |
| `{{SECTION_SUMMARY}}` | Professional Summary |
| `{{SUMMARY_TEXT}}` | Personalized summary with keywords |
| `{{SECTION_COMPETENCIES}}` | Core Competencies |
| `{{COMPETENCIES}}` | `<span class="competency-tag">keyword</span>` × 6–8 |
| `{{SECTION_EXPERIENCE}}` | Work Experience |
| `{{EXPERIENCE}}` | HTML for each job with reordered bullets |
| `{{SECTION_PROJECTS}}` | Projects |
| `{{PROJECTS}}` | HTML for the top 3–4 projects |
| `{{SECTION_EDUCATION}}` | Education |
| `{{EDUCATION}}` | Education HTML |
| `{{SECTION_CERTIFICATIONS}}` | Certifications |
| `{{CERTIFICATIONS}}` | Certifications HTML |
| `{{SECTION_SKILLS}}` | Skills |
| `{{SKILLS}}` | Skills HTML |

## Canva CV Generation (optional)

If `config/profile.yml` has `cv.canva_resume_design_id` set, offer the user a choice before generating:
- **"HTML/PDF (fast, ATS-optimized)"** — the existing flow above
- **"Canva CV (visual, design-preserving)"** — the flow below

If the user has no `cv.canva_resume_design_id`, skip this prompt and use the HTML/PDF flow.

### Canva workflow

#### Step 1 — Duplicate the base design

a. `export-design` the base design (using `cv.canva_resume_design_id`) as PDF → get download URL
b. `import-design-from-url` using that download URL → creates a new editable design (the duplicate)
c. Note the new `design_id` for the duplicate

#### Step 2 — Read the design structure

a. `get-design-content` on the new design → returns all text elements (richtexts) with their content
b. Map text elements to CV sections by content matching:
   - Look for the candidate's name → header section
   - Look for "Summary" or "Professional Summary" → summary section
   - Look for company names from __CV__ → experience sections
   - Look for degree/school names → education section
   - Look for skill keywords → skills section
c. If mapping fails, show the user what was found and ask for guidance

#### Step 3 — Generate tailored content

Same content generation as the HTML flow (Steps 1–11 above):
- Rewrite Professional Summary with JD keywords + exit narrative
- Reorder experience bullets by JD relevance
- Select top competencies from JD requirements
- Inject keywords naturally (NEVER invent)

**IMPORTANT — Character budget rule:** Each replacement text MUST be approximately the same length as the original text it replaces (within ±15% character count). If tailored content is longer, condense it. The Canva design has fixed-size text boxes — longer text causes overlapping with adjacent elements. Count the characters in each original element from Step 2 and enforce this budget when generating replacements.

#### Step 4 — Apply edits

a. `start-editing-transaction` on the duplicate design
b. `perform-editing-operations` with `find_and_replace_text` for each section:
   - Replace summary text with tailored summary
   - Replace each experience bullet with reordered/rewritten bullets
   - Replace competency/skills text with JD-matched terms
   - Replace project descriptions with top relevant projects
c. **Reflow layout after text replacement:**
   After applying all text replacements, the text boxes auto-resize but neighboring elements stay in place. This causes uneven spacing between work experience sections. Fix this:
   1. Read the updated element positions and dimensions from the `perform-editing-operations` response
   2. For each work experience section (top to bottom), calculate where the bullets text box ends: `end_y = top + height`
   3. The next section's header should start at `end_y + consistent_gap` (use the original gap from the template, typically ~30px)
   4. Use `position_element` to move the next section's date, company name, role title, and bullets elements to maintain even spacing
   5. Repeat for all work experience sections
d. **Verify layout before commit:**
   - `get-design-thumbnail` with the transaction_id and page_index=1
   - Visually inspect the thumbnail for: text overlapping, uneven spacing, text cut off, text too small
   - If issues remain, adjust with `position_element`, `resize_element`, or `format_text`
   - Repeat until layout is clean
d. Show the user the final preview and ask for approval
e. `commit-editing-transaction` to save (ONLY after user approval)

#### Step 5 — Export and download PDF

a. `export-design` the duplicate as PDF (format: a4 or letter based on JD location)
b. **IMMEDIATELY** download the PDF using Bash:
   ```bash
   curl -sL -o "__OUTPUT__/cv-{candidate}-{company}-canva-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf" "{download_url}"
   ```
   The export URL is a pre-signed S3 link that expires in ~2 hours. Download it right away.
c. Verify the download:
   ```bash
   file __OUTPUT__/cv-{candidate}-{company}-canva-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf
   ```
   Must show "PDF document". If it shows XML or HTML, the URL expired — re-export and retry.
d. Report: PDF path, file size, Canva design URL (for manual tweaking)

#### Error handling

- If `import-design-from-url` fails → fall back to HTML/PDF pipeline with message
- If text elements can't be mapped → warn user, show what was found, ask for manual mapping
- If `find_and_replace_text` finds no matches → try broader substring matching
- Always provide the Canva design URL so the user can edit manually if auto-edit fails
